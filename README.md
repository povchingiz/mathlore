# mathlore

This is for the idea to create an rpg game where you proceed inside the math lore.
Create internal math lore accurate world, like witcher or skyrim, where you can explore the world and complete quests, getting experience and knowledge!

ofc extandable idea to physics, comp sci lore. With their bosses and challenges.

Don't be a science npc!
